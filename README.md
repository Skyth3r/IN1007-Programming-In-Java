# Super Monkey Boy Java Game
## /Totally not a knock off clone of Super Meat Boy/  
This is a game I made for my Java module coursework in Netbeans. It is built using a modified version of JBox 2D (Engine-38).  

### Controls
A = Move left  
D = Move right  
W = Jump  
Shift = Sprint/Run  
Q = Exit the game  
(Holding left or right while jumping will allow the monkey to climb walls).  

### How to install
You will need the library ‘Engine-38’ which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9viyV2vsTZgenRCTEwydE5sbkE) to run the game in Netbeans.
